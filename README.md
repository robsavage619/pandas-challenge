Heroes of Pymoli Challenge 

The purpose of this excercise was to take a mid-size data set that included metrics for the microtransactions within Heroes of Pymoli and analyze them using different lines of code. 

The code written for this excercise helped analyze the following metrics:

- Purchasing habits based on gender
- Purchasing habits based on age
- Purchasing habits based on user
- The most popular in-game products
- The most profitable in-game products
- Overall demographics
- General purchasing information

Observations - 

1.) There is a surprising demographic gap in gender--84% of the unique players of HOP are male. There isn't a surprise that the majority are male, but more so that in 2020 we see such a large divide in the demo especially with female gamers becoming more prevalent in the market. 

2.) With basic knowledge of the economics and market trends of the gaming industry, with a total unique user pool of 576, the total revenue numbers of $2,379.77 are awfully low. The entire industry is making the shift towards microtransactions and these figures need to rise dramatically.

3.) The sweet spot for the game's marketing department is the 20-24 age range. Not only does it hold the largest player base, it has the highest average total purchase per person. There's a significant increase from 15-19 to 20-24, which is explained by the the presumed increase in disposable income.
